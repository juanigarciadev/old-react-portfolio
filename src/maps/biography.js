    bio: "Having finished high school, I began taking courses related to programming. I started with Web Development (HTML & CSS) from which I managed to finish with the highest score possible, thus achieving entry into the TOP 10% best students. This was repeated with the Javascript and Photoshop & Illustrator courses in which I also achieved the highest possible score and entered the TOP 10% best students. I had really found what I was passionate about and had managed to connect with the way of learning I was taking.",

    bio: "Once the holidays were over and having learned much more about Web Development in a didactic way, I decided to start a course to learn my first framework (or library in this case), React. I managed to connect very quickly with the new way of doing things, I created my first project using the library and again, I got the maximum score, once again being in the TOP 10% of the students. Once these first steps were completed, I decided not to go into the back-end for the moment since I felt that I still had some weaknesses in the front-end so I have continued educating myself about it, learning CSS frameworks such as Tailwind and learning about protyping, which I did the Prototyping course in Figma and Adobe XD of which, I again managed to achieve the maximum score again, also obtaining the medal for the TOP 10% of students.",
